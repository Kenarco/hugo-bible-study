        <description>The Creatiom The account of Creation is the logical starting point for Genesis, for it explains the beginning of the universe. These verses have received much attention in connection with science; this is to be expected. But the passage is a theological treatise as well, for it lays a foundation for the rest of the Pentateuch.
In writing this work for Israel, Moses wished to portray God as the Founder and Creator of all life.</description>
