      <description>The Temptation and thr fall&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;3:1–7. These verses provide both the record of the historical Fall of man and the archetypal temptation. This passage is a perfect case study of temptation, for sin cannot be blamed on environment or heredity.&#xA;Genesis 1–2 recorded what God said; now the serpent (the devil, Rev. 20:2) spoke. The word of the Lord brought life and order; the word of the serpent brought chaos and death.</description>

      <description>The Creation of the Man and Woman&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;2:4a. This section (vv. 4–25), as indicated in verse 4a, traces the account of (what became of) the heavens and the earth when (beyôm, lit., “in the day,” an idiom for “when”) they were created. What became of Creation is that sin entered and devastated it.&#xA;2:4b–7. In the creation of Adam the contrast is striking: against the background of a time when there was no life, no growth, no rain, no one to till the ground, God took great care in forming man.</description>

      <description>The Creatiom&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;The account of Creation is the logical starting point for Genesis, for it explains the beginning of the universe. These verses have received much attention in connection with science; this is to be expected. But the passage is a theological treatise as well, for it lays a foundation for the rest of the Pentateuch.&#xA;In writing this work for Israel, Moses wished to portray God as the Founder and Creator of all life.</description>
