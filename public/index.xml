        <description>The Creation of the Man and Woman 2:4a. This section (vv. 4–25), as indicated in verse 4a, traces the account of (what became of) the heavens and the earth when (beyôm, lit., “in the day,” an idiom for “when”) they were created. What became of Creation is that sin entered and devastated it.
2:4b–7. In the creation of Adam the contrast is striking: against the background of a time when there was no life, no growth, no rain, no one to till the ground, God took great care in forming man.</description>

        <description>The Creatiom The account of Creation is the logical starting point for Genesis, for it explains the beginning of the universe. These verses have received much attention in connection with science; this is to be expected. But the passage is a theological treatise as well, for it lays a foundation for the rest of the Pentateuch.
In writing this work for Israel, Moses wished to portray God as the Founder and Creator of all life.</description>
